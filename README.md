# thumbnail_creator

This app takes a source image, and allows you to create a square thumbnail from it, with scaling if required.

Use the mouse wheel to zoom the thumbnail select area in/out, and click/drag to move it around the image.

You can see the output scale and coordinates by calling these properties in the console:

thumbnail_preview.left_pixel_value_of_source_image

thumbnail_preview.top_pixel_value_of_source_image

thumbnail_preview.scale
